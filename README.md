# Horiseon

## Project
Client A (representing their marketing agency Horiseon) requests if I can refactor their website to follow their accessibility standards,
so that it is optimized for search engines.

Their standards follow:

* Semantic HTML elements are found when viewed

* Structure of HTML elements follow a logical
structure independent of styling and positioning

* Accessible alt attributes are portrayed when
the icon and image elements are viewed

* Heading attributes follow a sequential order

* Adding a concise and descriptive title 


## Description

To meet my clients criteria, I modified their codebase by ecexuting the following actions:

* Added a head title that best represents their company

* Added spacing, indention, and comments; so that the codebase is clean, heading attributes 
follow a sequential order, and is convenient for veiwer to browse semantics

* Added alt attributes for all img elements; This resulted in creating a section for 
company image/background, so that it has an alt attribute

* Ensuring all head directories(including the title) link to their corresponding
element

* Removing unneccessary semantics and replacing them with proper
replacements, so that the HTML elements follow a logical structure

* Edited the CSS stylesheet to function with the 
corresponding changes of the HTML semantics/elements
